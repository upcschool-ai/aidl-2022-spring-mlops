# Session 6
Train and use a model using Docker.

## Installation
You should create a Dockerfile and build the image using `docker build`
 
## Running the project
Once the project is done, you can train it by running the command `docker run <IMAGE_NAME> train`, and predict with the command `docker run <IMAGE_NAME> predict <INPUT_FEATURES>`. Note that you will need to mount some volumes when using `docker run`, otherwise these commands won't work.
